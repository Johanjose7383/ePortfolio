communication concepts are ask questions

 -I am studying bachelors in Inforamtion Technology, I have a subject called proffessional communicational skills for ICT and  have a presentation for augmented reality in that subject. The presentation was really good and was impressed by everyone in the class.

3.Work effectively as part of a team
- In my last position as a sales assistant for Jumbo Traders, Our Manager asked us if we could a sales campaign to promote the sales. We were all worked together to plan and designed posters with some attracting offers marketed in the social medias like facebook, instagram etc. We were also distributed some handouts as well. This worked very well due to the promotional offer and the reach received from our campaign, the sales went up to the peak. We were all super excited and our manager was extremely happy and provided us some cash bonus. 
- In our church, there was a requirement to make a parish directory. The church management committee requested the youth members to volunteer it and assist church in getting information from all parish members. We the youth members formed multiple groups based on the location and cordinated the members. Although, its a straight forward task, there was a lot of work involved as the members were all so rigid and so we had to contact them multiple times to complete the google/survey form. This was then compiled by our team which then printed and distributed among the parish members. Church committee appreciated all the youth memebers.


4.Communicate effectively in a professional context
- I was working as a retail manager in my previous job. End of the year stock taking is a big task and time consuming. Since there were a lot of erros in the year before, I have requested approval for overtime from my manager. I have introduced a more efficient system to records the stocks which inturn reduces the discrepancies.

5.Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies
- When i was working at jumbo traders there was a conflict between the manager and a customer. The customer was very angry and shouted to the manager. The reason was the product which he bought was damaged. I just calm him down and make him understand the situation by that the company will refund the whole of your product or we wiil repalce the product as soon as possible.
